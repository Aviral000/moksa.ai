BACKEND - I use Express and MONGODB(ODM)
every 5 sec a new result is being generated and based on model, it will prvoide some info related to in and out customer

Frontend - I use webapck to utilize all the module
I create a simple dashboard using GSAP, Material UI, SCSS(SASS), and few more things, which keep updating the live customer and store the wholesome value as a history.

Start:
clone everything, backend and frontend
for backend use 'npm run dev' to start
for frontend use 'npm start' to start

on github, i will also provide a live link if possible

LIVE SERVER problem
live server can't keep up with the speed database changes, because of free service have its own criteria

Use clown and run localhost
